Train Booking Service

  In this train ticket service is implemented on top of servlet which is very simple to create dynamic web pages. 
  Here we used HashMap data structure to store the data. So once server restarted, data will not be available.
  Since we are diving into Java, we can convert Tickets, Users & Trains as Objects to use java properties.
